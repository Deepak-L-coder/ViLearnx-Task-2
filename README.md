# Task 2 : SIMPLE CALCULATOR

In this project, I developed a simple yet functional calculator using Python. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project focuses on applying core programming concepts like control structures, user input handling, and basic error checking, all implemented in a user-friendly command-line interface.


## Features

- Addition: Adds two numbers.

- Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.

- Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers

- Division: Divides one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.
